# VIM
Note repository on VIM

This repository will be used as an area to store markdown formatted notes taken during a VIM training course on ACloudGuru called "Text Editing with Vim".  The purpose of this is to practice issuing git commands within Windows Subsystem for Linux, and to practice learning VIM while using it to take notes formatted in markdown.
